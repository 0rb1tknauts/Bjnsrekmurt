The program is a parking lot manager, it takes in information regarding the person's name, pass type, plate, and the car itself.
It will then reorganize that data into the hashtable's buckets based on the pass types (red, green, purple), with those buckets having a linked list for each one, in order to allow the program add more than 1 student to each parking lot or bucket.

I felt the program is pretty good, I learned a bit more when it came to using enum and hashtables. Never enough time, unfortunately.
I enjoyed working in groups, however, I believe if it was set up during the start of the year (though impossible for this semester), it would've made it easier to get used to working with groups,
especially on the aspect of creating our own programs without many "required" aspects to it.
I believe git could've been done differently, as in I believe even 1300 and 1310 should've used it far more than it did for the programs, I do believe it was a good idea to use git though.
I believe for some feedback is that students should be shown how to work together on a project, the only aspect I know is the whole driving and passenger thing but that is not adequate enough for real world situations and it was how I taught in 1300.
In general, I enjoyed the project.
